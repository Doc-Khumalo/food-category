##Build Built from scratch and manually installing node modules

This is a quick mock up of a web-app to display dynamic context using [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), a Promise based HTTP client for the browser. 
To be able to run this build, navigate to the root folder and then in terminal, run <code>npm install</code>
Then after the install is complete, run <code>npm start</code>. 
This will build the app and then launch the view in your browser http://localhost:8080/ 

###Future Scopes
- cover test coverage
- explore how and implement search functionality
- possibly spread classes as components in different files
